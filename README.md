# odin-landing-page
A simple landing page for The Odin Project

## Technologies
CSS + HTML, built mostly with flexbox

## Lessons learned
The biggest part of this project was learning how to use flexbox, especially several flexboxes within each other. I also refined my skills using more basic CSS attributes and patterns like centering objects, creating layouts, sections, etc. What I'm most happy with on this project is the overall design of the site. I think I learned quite a lot about what makes a page look good concering colors, size, etc. I even implemented some responsive design elements although it doesn't work on mobile yet. I'll likely revisit this project at a later time to make it mobile-friendly.
